Cooksville is an online one vs one cooking competition. Player A competes against player B by retrieving orders, gathering ingredients, preparing dishes, and delivering them to the customers.

Cooksville was a capstone project developed by a group of 7 programmers including me as the team leader in 3 months. The game was developed using Unity and C# language.
